# TriviaQA: Open-Domain Question Answering
A very short readme for our GitHub repository. The Pinecone.io token for the dense database can be provided upon request. The amount of commits is inflated, because we have merged multiple branches that had the same pre-commits and spent some time renaming and organising all files. We opted to keep the inflated amount in order to keep the complete commit history for each file.

## Usage
The notebooks are well documented inside:

#### test_models.ipynb:
Use this notebook as a sandbox to experiment with models, change hyperparameters.

#### evaluate_model.ipynb:
Use this to run the evaluation chain and get the final results. 

## Structure

#### database_training:
Here are the notebooks used for the training of our databases, you can use them to re-train or create new ones.

#### databases:
In this folder you can find the sparse and hybrid databases, that we've elected to host in GitHub.

#### evaluation:
Here are the elements for our evaluation chain.

#### models:
All models we have used are saved here as separate classes to be used in the test and evaluation notebooks.

#### results:
The final evaluation results are saved here for future processing.
